# About

Collection of scripts and IPython notebooks for benchmarking the Fizzy feature selection tool for metagenomics. Make sure that you are using the lastest version of [Fizzy](https://github.com/EESI/Fizzy) prior to trying to reproduce the results found here. Note that Fizzy requires the [PyFeast](https://github.com/EESI/PyFeast) and [PyNPFS](https://github.com/EESI/py-npfs) modules to run.  

## Setting up the Environment

Other than the software programs shown above, you'll need to download the data from one of our other GitHub repositories. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gditzler/Fizzy-Benchmarks.git
git clone https://github.com/gditzler/DataCollections.git
```
Please refer to the individual repositories for configuring Fizzy, PyFEAST and PyNPFS.
